Playground Hopping around Louisville: My Code Louisville Project

This is a simple webpage I created about local playgrounds and what my kids and I like about them. It includes a photo of each playground, link to its location, and brief checklist of pros and cons of each playground.
It was built with a mobile-first design and includes media queries for tablet and desktop views. 



The top navigation bar features transitions upon hover in the desktop view.

I ran an accessibility check which stated that the Instagram and LinkedIn links at the bottom did not have discernible names so I added aria-labels to the anchor tags describing what they are.

I added a hide/show div at the bottom which revealed my favorite playground upon clicking (you have to click twice the first time to show it).

I ran a pagespeed test and received a score of 76.
