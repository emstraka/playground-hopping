Playground Hopping around Louisville: My Code Louisville Project

This is a simple webpage I created about local playgrounds and what my kids and I like about them.

I utilized a JavaScript feature in a "Contact Me" form that alerts the user when they have entered a valid or invalid information email address.

I created a navigation menu that expands and collapses at desktop and mobile sizes.
